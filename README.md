# Terraform on Azure: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Saurav

Welcome to the ultimate guide on using Terraform with Azure. This repository provides a comprehensive overview of how to manage Azure infrastructure using Terraform, including features, use cases, and detailed implementation steps.

## Overview üåê

**Terraform** is a powerful open-source tool by HashiCorp for defining, provisioning, and managing infrastructure as code (IaC). When used with **Azure**, Terraform allows you to automate the deployment and management of Azure resources with ease, ensuring consistency and efficiency across your cloud environments.

## Key Features of Terraform with Azure üöÄ

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define Azure resources using configuration files, versioned and managed like any other code.
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Manage resources across different Azure services and integrate with other cloud providers if needed.
- **Declarative Configuration:** Describe your desired infrastructure state using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) or JSON, and let Terraform handle the provisioning.
- **State Management:** Maintain state files that keep track of your Azure resources, allowing Terraform to make incremental updates and manage dependencies.
- **Modular Design:** Create reusable Terraform modules to encapsulate and manage Azure resource configurations efficiently.
- **Plan and Apply:** Generate execution plans to preview changes before applying them, reducing the risk of unintended changes.

## Use Cases for Terraform with Azure üåü

1. **Azure Resource Provisioning:** Automate the creation of Azure resources like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, and Networking components.
2. **Environment Management:** Maintain consistent configurations across multiple environments (development, staging, production) using reusable modules.
3. **Infrastructure Scaling:** Adjust resource configurations to scale your infrastructure based on demand with minimal manual intervention.
4. **Disaster Recovery:** Quickly replicate your Azure infrastructure in different regions to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.
5. **Compliance and Security:** Ensure infrastructure adheres to organizational standards and compliance requirements by codifying configurations.

## Getting Started with Terraform on Azure üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Install Terraform

**Windows:**
1. Download the [Terraform binary](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Add it to your system PATH.

**macOS:**
1. Use Homebrew: `brew install terraform`.

**Linux:**
1. Download the binary from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Add it to your PATH.

### 2. Set Up Azure Provider

Create a directory for your Terraform configuration and add a file named `main.tf`. Here‚Äôs an example configuration to provision an Azure Virtual Machine:

```hcl
# Specify the Azure provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Define a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

# Define an Azure Virtual Network
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

# Define an Azure Virtual Machine
resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                  = "example-vm"
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location              = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  size                  = "Standard_DS1_v2"
  admin_username        = "adminuser"
  network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example.id]
  os_disk {
    caching              = "ReadWrite"
    storage_account_type  = "Premium_LRS"
    name                  = "myosdisk"
  }
  source_image_reference {
    publisher = "MicrosoftWindowsServer"
    offer     = "WindowsServer"
    sku       = "2019-Datacenter"
    version   = "latest"
  }
}
