# Terraform on Azure: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Saurav

Welcome to the ultimate guide on using Terraform with Azure. This repository provides a comprehensive overview of how to manage Azure infrastructure using Terraform, including features, use cases, and detailed implementation steps.

## Overview üåê

**Terraform** is a powerful open-source tool by HashiCorp for defining, provisioning, and managing infrastructure as code (IaC). When used with **Azure**, Terraform allows you to automate the deployment and management of Azure resources with ease, ensuring consistency and efficiency across your cloud environments.

## Key Features of Terraform with Azure üöÄ

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define Azure resources using configuration files, versioned and managed like any other code.
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Manage resources across different Azure services and integrate with other cloud providers if needed.
- **Declarative Configuration:** Describe your desired infrastructure state using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) or JSON, and let Terraform handle the provisioning.
- **State Management:** Maintain state files that keep track of your Azure resources, allowing Terraform to make incremental updates and manage dependencies.
- **Modular Design:** Create reusable Terraform modules to encapsulate and manage Azure resource configurations efficiently.
- **Plan and Apply:** Generate execution plans to preview changes before applying them, reducing the risk of unintended changes.

## Use Cases for Terraform with Azure üåü

1. **Azure Resource Provisioning:** Automate the creation of Azure resources like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, and Networking components.
2. **Environment Management:** Maintain consistent configurations across multiple environments (development, staging, production) using reusable modules.
3. **Infrastructure Scaling:** Adjust resource configurations to scale your infrastructure based on demand with minimal manual intervention.
4. **Disaster Recovery:** Quickly replicate your Azure infrastructure in different regions to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.
5. **Compliance and Security:** Ensure infrastructure adheres to organizational standards and compliance requirements by codifying configurations.

## Getting Started with Terraform on Azure üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Install Terraform

**Windows:**
1. Download the [Terraform binary](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Add it to your system PATH.

**macOS:**
1. Use Homebrew: `brew install terraform`.

**Linux:**
1. Download the binary from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. Add it to your PATH.

### 2. Set Up Azure Provider

Create a directory for your Terraform configuration and add a file named `main.tf`. Here‚Äôs an example configuration to provision an Azure Virtual Machine:

```hcl
# Specify the Azure provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Define a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

# Define an Azure Virtual Network
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

# Define an Azure Virtual Machine
resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                  = "example-vm"
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location              = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  size                  = "Standard_DS1_v2"
  admin_username        = "adminuser"
  network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example.id]
  os_disk {
    caching              = "ReadWrite"
    storage_account_type  = "Premium_LRS"
    name                  = "myosdisk"
  }
  source_image_reference {
    publisher = "MicrosoftWindowsServer"
    offer     = "WindowsServer"
    sku       = "2019-Datacenter"
    version   = "latest"
  }
}

**3. Initialize Your Terraform Project**
Run terraform init to initialize your Terraform project and download the necessary Azure provider plugin.

bash
Copy code
terraform init
**4. Plan Your Changes**
Generate an execution plan to preview the changes Terraform will make to your Azure infrastructure. Review and validate the plan before applying it.

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
**5. Apply Your Changes**
Apply the changes defined in your configuration file to create or update your Azure resources.

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
**6. Manage State Files**
Terraform uses state files to track your resources. Secure and back up your state files appropriately. Consider using Azure Storage for remote state management.

Example of configuring remote state in Azure Storage:

hcl
Copy code
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "tfstate"
    storage_account_name = "tfstatestorageaccount"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
**7. Use Modules**
Organize and reuse configurations using modules. Create a modules directory and define your modules in subdirectories.

Directory Structure:

plaintext
Copy code
modules/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ virtual-network/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf
Module Definition (modules/virtual-network/main.tf):

hcl
Copy code
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "this" {
  name                = var.name
  address_space       = var.address_space
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}
Using the Module in Your Main Configuration (main.tf):

hcl
Copy code
module "vnet" {
  source             = "./modules/virtual-network"
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}
**8. Version Control**
Store your Terraform configuration files in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others.

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
**Best Practices for Terraform with Azure üõ°Ô∏è**
Use Modules: Encapsulate and reuse configurations with modules to avoid redundancy and maintain organization.
Secure State Files: Use Azure Storage or Terraform Cloud for remote state management and ensure state files are backed up and protected.
Follow Naming Conventions: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for resources and variables to improve readability and manageability.
Review Plans: Always review the execution plan before applying changes to avoid unintended modifications.
Document Configurations: Include comments and documentation in your configuration files to ensure clarity and ease of maintenance.
